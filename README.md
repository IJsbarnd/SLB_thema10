This is my SLB repository. I am IJsbrand Pool. I am 19 years old and i live in Zwolle. I study bio-informatics at the Hanze Hogeschool Groningen.

My intrests lie mostly in the programming side of this study. I like writing scripts in Python and Java. I can also work with statistics in R, or with databases with SQL.
I can make websites usign a mix of Python/Java + JavaScript and HTML + CSS. I have also learned lots about genetics and the biology of cells and DNA.
I like combining these talents in the school projects. These projects have learned me a lot of how things will be in the workfield.
